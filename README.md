# SYMPTOM--BASED-DISEASE-PREDICTION-SYSTEM
Early detection of diseases is critical for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. This project leverages machine learning to create a Symptom-Based Disease Prediction System, which identifies potential medical conditions based on user-provided symptoms. The platform also offers diet chart recommendations tailored to the predicted diagnosis, promoting holistic health management.

ðŸš€ Features
- Disease Prediction: Utilize advanced ML algorithms (SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to predict diseases with high precision.
- Diet Chart Recommendations: Generate personalized nutritional plans based on predicted conditions.
- User-Friendly Interface: Interactive and intuitive web-based interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.
- Reliability: Trained on comprehensive medical datasets to ensure accuracy and reliability.
